Didn't we talk about that already?*</p><p>My teaching is messy, and I try to keep it as conversational as possible. I got really inspired by well-crafted conversations, like the ones in Richard Linklater's scripts. I think the best conversations someone can experience when learning a language a well-done representations of someone sharing something interesting with you, instead of someone walking you through a printed page saying "Next...", like a family member showing the photos of their last trip in front of everyone.</p><h2>Elements of a movie-like lesson
