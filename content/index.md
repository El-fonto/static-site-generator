Here's the thing, I like talking to people all day.
I learn a lot from them, and (I hope) they learn from me. 

A quote that I really liked:
> Pressure is privilege

## Reasons I like talking with people

- We can watch videos together and comment them.
- I can't get better at my understanding of the world talking to other professionals.
- There's always a learning expectation from both of us, but there aren't any forbidden topics.
- It created a way of living where I can think about language and meet new interesting people.

1. Psychology
2. Productivity
3. Art
4. Culture
5. History
