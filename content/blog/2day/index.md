# Day Two: created a loop

Today, I built a loop that gets input inside a simple data structure. 

Then I also checked how to log time of input accordingly. The thing that I was trying to achieve today was to have a functional way to retrieve my input in an organized manner. I think the data structure needs to be a bit different, because the things that I'm inputting are too close to each other, and later I would need that everything that I add goes to a simple file to save it.

The things that I have pending are how to read a calendar, so I can look up for matches and then I would like to know if I could import my calendar and then read from it, write another calendar or something in between. I would like to generate a copy of my current calendar, but override the class events that I have, so I can have my notes over my calendar invitations and then, I could review what are we doing during those lessons.  I would love to find an automatic way of checking my files and getting a calendar into this.
