# Why making a diary for my tutoring

The first thing that I had problems when I started working with private students was tracking everything that I do with them.

The hardest part of designing a personalized curriculum is that, from time to time, things overlap; and, you'll end up presenting a class that you might prepared before to the same student. 

That has happened to me in more than one occasion. 
> _Today, I'd like to discuss... _
> *I think that I saw that before... Didn't we talk about that already?*

My teaching is messy, and I try to keep it as conversational as possible. I got really inspired by well-crafted conversations, like the ones in Richard Linklater's scripts. I think the best conversations someone can experience when learning a language a well-done representations of someone sharing something interesting with you, instead of someone walking you through a printed page saying "Next...", like a family member showing the photos of their last trip in front of everyone.
